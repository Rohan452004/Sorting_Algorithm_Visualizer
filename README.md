## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a dynamic sorting algorithm visualizer capable of illustrating the step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms on a dynamic dataset. This tool is designed to help users understand how sorting algorithms work by providing a clear, visual representation of the sorting process.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms

This visualizer includes the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort** - A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Insertion Sort** - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position.
3. **Selection Sort** - Divides the array into a sorted and unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region.
4. **Ripple Sort** - Similar to bubble sort but with a bidirectional approach, swapping in both directions.

## User Interaction

Users can interact with the visualizer using the following keyboard inputs:

- **`s`**: Start or resume the sorting process.
- **`p`**: Pause the sorting process.
- **`r`**: Randomize the dataset to see how the algorithm handles different inputs.
- **`c`**: Switch to the next sorting algorithm in the list.
